## Components
### Ultrasonic sensor
 The ultrasonic sensor is a non contact type device which uses the sound waves. There are 2 ports on the front, one port generates 
 the ultrasonic waves like a micro speaker and other port receivers. The ultrasonic waves like a small micro phone. The liquid 
 level is calculated, on the basis of the total time required for the sound to reflect back.

### Arduino
 Arduino is a one type of micro controller circuit ATmega328P. The programme is carried out in the arduino by using the arduino 
 software in the programming languages like C and C++ .

### Water pump(motor)
 Pump is a mechanical device which converts the mechanical energy into the pressure energy. It creates the partial vacuum in the suction side and sucks the liquid which is delivered with high pressure at a required height.

### Power Supply
 It is the main component of the whole system. It suppy power to all the components in the system.

### LED
 Shows the status of motor wether it is on or off.

### Resistors
 to protect LED and complete the circuit.

# Applications
 * Gauge and Manage water levels in a water tank.
 * Automating the conrol of motor.
 * Save water or any other precious liquid material.
