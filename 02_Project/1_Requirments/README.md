# Description
 water level indicator using ultrasonic sensor &arduino is an amazing and very useful project. the
 objective of this project is to notify the user the amount of water that is present in the overhead water
 tank. this project can be further enhanced to control the water level in the tank by turning it on, when the
 water level is low, and turning it off when the water level is high. thus, the arduino water level indicator
 helps in preventing wastage of water in overhead tank.

# SWOT
 ## Strength
  * Very easy to use.
  * Quick installment.
  * Very Reliable.

## Weakness
 * Lack of graphical user interface.
 * If the Ardunio gets reset the system will not work.
 * System is very sensitive we have to handle it with care.

## Opportunity
 * Since now a days water usage is increassing so much it is very important to save the water so this kind of systems are required.

## Threats
 * Better system can be developed or designed using various other technologies.
